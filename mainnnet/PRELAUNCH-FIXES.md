# Mainnet prelaunch fixes

Updated 2026-09-16. This is the canonical tracker for fixes to complete before
mainnet launch. The initial workstream is automatic handling of compatible
Subtensor runtime upgrades. All implementation items below are planned;
no completed implementation or qualification is claimed.

For each item, record its implementation commit and relevant test or operational
evidence before marking it done. Add newly discovered adjacent issues here.
The active testnet finalization continues independently.

## Runtime-upgrade fix tracker

| ID | Fix | Depends on | Owner | Status | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RT-01 | Immutable runtime views anchored to the correct block and purpose | — | Astra | Planned | Current reads, historical execution and concurrent signing use consistent, separate contexts. |
| RT-02 | Shared capability profiles for calls, storage, signing, CRv4, custom APIs and precompiles | — | Astra | Planned | Compatible versions pass automatically; changed consumed interfaces identify the precise unsupported capability. |
| RT-03 | Construct and sign each native operation from one view; reconcile stale or uncertain attempts | RT-01, RT-02 | Astra | Planned | Deterministic upgrade races preserve signed history and cause no duplicate transaction. |
| RT-04 | Replace version-specific live admission in simulator, miner, both validator paths and bootstrap | RT-01, RT-02, RT-03 | Astra | Planned | A compatible upgrade needs no binary rebuild or manually added version entry. |
| RT-05 | Separate observed runtime from deployment, configuration and approval identity | RT-02, RT-04 | Astra | Planned | A compatible upgrade preserves the plan, approvals, leases, completed actions and observed epochs. |
| RT-06 | Preserve historical proof reuse and make metadata-cache capacity independent of catalog length | RT-01, RT-02 | Astra | Planned | Older proofs remain correctly authenticated; eviction, restart and additional runtime versions retain valid progress. |
| RT-07 | Suspend only operations affected by an unsupported change and expose an actionable reason | RT-02, RT-04 | Astra | Planned | Independent services continue where their dependencies permit; recovery resumes from saved progress. |
| RT-08 | Qualify upgrade handling and record the mainnet-readiness evidence | RT-01 through RT-07 | Terra | Planned | Affected normal/race tests and a controlled upgrade during an active integration campaign pass with unchanged approvals and reconciled transactions. |

RT-01 and RT-02 can proceed in parallel. After those foundations, cache/history,
transaction handling and operation-specific admission can progress independently
where their inputs are stable. An external manually reviewed artifact catalog
may be an interim aid; it does not complete RT-04's automatic-upgrade requirement.

## Runtime-upgrade compatibility proposal

Proposed design, 2026-09-16. Compatible chain upgrades should continue without
a subnet rebuild, plan migration, repeated funding, audit restart or lost soak
progress. The active testnet finalization continues with its qualified release;
this document describes the subsequent implementation.

## Why upgrades currently interrupt us

Current admission selects one compiled runtime artifact in
[crv4/reviewed_runtime.go](../crv4/reviewed_runtime.go), with separate consumers in
[validator/runtime_identity.go](../validator/runtime_identity.go),
[miner/fleet_runtime.go](../miner/fleet_runtime.go) and
[sim-testnet/runtime_identity.go](../sim-testnet/runtime_identity.go).
[runtime_config_identity.go](../sim-testnet/runtime_config_identity.go) also lists
specific permitted version transitions. Consequently a compatible chain
upgrade can require source edits, a release lock, a build and a new plan.

The [459-to-460 review](../docs/spec/runtime-460-audit.md) found unchanged interfaces
used by SN and a metadata change confined to the version constant. Runtime
staking internals nevertheless changed. That distinction matters: a metadata
comparison can establish encoding compatibility, but cannot prove all economic
behavior equivalent.

The SDK treats `spec_version` as a runtime specification identifier; even bug
fixes can change it. `transaction_version` describes dispatchable-call
compatibility under the SDK's versioning contract. Neither value alone proves
compatibility of every storage reader, custom runtime API or precompile we use.
[SDK runtime-version semantics](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_version/struct.RuntimeVersion.html).

## Proposed operation model

Use a shared resolver in the existing native-chain layer. An operation asks
for the capabilities it needs and receives an immutable runtime view:

- Chain genesis, anchored block hash and observed runtime versions.
- Code and metadata hashes, with the actual metadata and supported encoders.
- The compatibility-policy revision and admitted operation profiles.
- The context's purpose: post-state reads, historical block execution, or
  construction of a new transaction.

Exact hashes remain evidence. Supported operation profiles determine whether
work can proceed. Do not mutate a connection-wide decoder while historical
readers or transaction constructors still use it. At upgrade boundaries,
distinguish the runtime executing a block from the runtime installed in its
post-state; historical events and extrinsics must use their execution context.

An unknown version number with an admitted profile proceeds automatically.
An unsupported capability produces a specific error and suspends its dependent
operations. Other capabilities continue where their dependencies permit it.
Keep completed actions and observed epochs; a missing required observation
still cannot be counted as a fully observed acceptance epoch.

## Compatibility checks

Check only the interfaces an operation consumes, using canonical structural
types rather than portable metadata type numbers or a hash of all metadata.
Unrelated pallets, documentation and version constants should not invalidate
an otherwise identical interface.

| Boundary | Required checks |
| --- | --- |
| Native calls | Call identity and argument order/types; resolve indices from admitted metadata where possible. |
| Storage | Keys, hashers, value types, optional/default behavior and relevant constants. |
| Signing | Extrinsic format and complete ordered signed-extension encoding and semantics supported by the signer. |
| Runtime APIs | Method/version and response encoding, including the selective metagraph API. |
| CRv4 | Prepared payload and source-commitment encoding, call indices, reveal rules and signing domain. |
| EVM integration | EVM chain identity, receipt/checkpoint mapping, required precompile interfaces and behavior. |
| Economic operations | Existing permission, fee, balance, collateral, reserve and scheduling bounds, plus action postconditions. |

Existing [CheckMetadata](../crv4/chain.go) needs stronger shape validation; storage
presence and an unknown extension having zero encoded size are insufficient
for automatic write admission. [preparedSourceEncoding](../crv4/source_commitment.go)
and the [selective-metagraph reader](../crv4/validator_stake.go) need explicit
encoding/API profiles to replace their version-number lists. Metadata format
v14 alone does not establish the custom API's return layout.

Automatic admission accepts upgrades authorized by the chain's governance
within these supported capabilities and operational bounds. It is not a proof
that arbitrary new runtime code preserves every economic rule. A semantic
change can retain its wire encoding; dry runs where available and ongoing
postcondition checks improve detection but do not eliminate that limitation.

## Upgrade and transaction handling

1. Observe an upgrade through the owned node and anchor the runtime context to
   a canonical block. A subscription is a notification; fetch matching version,
   code identity and metadata from the appropriate block context.
2. Validate the required profiles once per artifact and policy revision. Record
   the result and atomically make the context available to new operations.
3. Construct and sign a native transaction from the same immutable context,
   using its observed signing versions. Recheck the context before publishing
   signed bytes; handle an upgrade racing broadcast through reconciliation.
4. Preserve signed attempts. Establish inclusion, failure and nonce state before
   replacing a stale attempt. An uncertain submission must never trigger a
   blind repeat of a transfer or another non-idempotent action.
5. Append the new runtime observation and continue the existing campaign.

The SDK's `CheckSpecVersion` rejects transactions carrying an obsolete signing
version, so automatic compatibility cannot mean retaining stale signing data.
[SDK signing-version check](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_system/struct.CheckSpecVersion.html).

In particular, [SubstrateManager](../sim-testnet/substrate.go) currently authenticates
a fresh head separately from the shared metadata used to construct calls.
`SendAsWithRecoveryPrecondition` accepts an already-built call. Change this
boundary so the admitted runtime view controls both construction and signing.
Widening the current allowlist alone would leave this gap.

Existing prepared CRv4 work retains its original bytes, runtime identity and
signatures. Any replacement is an explicit reconciled attempt; historical
proofs are never rewritten to name the newest runtime. EVM signatures use EVM
chain identity, so a native spec bump alone does not invalidate their bytes.
Relevant precompile and checkpoint behavior still requires admission.

## Stable identity, history and caches

Bind future deployment/configuration identity to chain identity, approved
economics and the compatibility policy. Store runtime observations separately
in the journal. A compatible observation should not change the plan hash,
activation identity, fleet leases, reserve-repair liabilities or approvals.
Every new signed artifact still records its own exact runtime and block
identity; the stable deployment policy does not replace its signing domain.
Existing signed manifests keep their original identity through an explicit
initial schema transition; do not reinterpret old hashes in place.

Historical reads select the applicable original artifact and adapter. Cache
their evidence with its block/artifact identity, verifier policy and actual
dependencies. Reuse a successful proof when those inputs are unchanged; a new
live runtime is not itself a reason to revalidate old facts. Continue checking
fresh balances, permits, fees and nonce state when an operation needs them.

The durable [historical audit cache](../sim-testnet/historical_audit_cache.go)
currently includes plan, release and executable identity. Eliminating routine
rebuilds and plan migrations preserves those existing cache hits. Any later
narrowing of cache keys must separately prove that verifier and authority
changes still invalidate affected proofs.

Replace the [metadata cache](../crv4/runtime_identity.go)'s catalog-sized lifetime
ceiling with fixed memory/byte limits and safe eviction. Runtime discovery and
admissible history must not stop merely because more versions have appeared.
Persist content-addressed artifacts when needed; an evicted entry can be loaded
and authenticated again. Cache bounded successful compatibility decisions;
do not let transient RPC failures poison admission.

## Delivery and acceptance

Implement immutable runtime views and shared profiles first, with comparison
against current admission during qualification. Then migrate live operations
and future plan identity to the policy model. An external reviewed artifact
catalog can remove recompilation as an interim step, but a manually maintained
catalog alone does not satisfy automatic upgrade handling.

Add deterministic synthetic tests following [CODESTYLE.md](../../connect/CODESTYLE.md):

- A higher spec version with compatible interfaces continues reads, signing and
  a running campaign without a new plan or repeated completed action.
- Unrelated metadata changes and type-number renumbering remain compatible.
- An upgrade between construction, signing and broadcast never mixes contexts
  or duplicates a submitted transaction, including uncertain outcomes.
- Upgrade-boundary and older-history decoding preserve their original runtime
  and signing domains while current work uses the new context.
- Changed consumed storage/call/API shapes and unsupported signed extensions
  suspend the affected operation with a precise reason.
- Semantic bounds still reject unsafe fee, permission, reserve or scheduling
  results even when their wire format is unchanged.
- Artifact eviction, RPC outage/reconnect and process restart retain valid
  progress and cannot turn stale or failed evidence into a passing result.

Astra diagnoses and implements; Terra runs affected tests normally and under
race. The final integration exercise upgrades a controlled runtime while the
subnet is active and demonstrates continued required observations, reconciled
transactions and unchanged approvals. This architecture work is not an extra
preparation gate for the currently running testnet recovery.
